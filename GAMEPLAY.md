# Gameplay scope and current implementation

## Long-term direction

Kor Eternal Frontier is a colony, civilization, and world simulation. Population, construction, work, transport, inventory, production, research, regional development, and The Blight should influence one another.

The local map uses orthogonal 2D square tiles. Placeholder symbols prioritize readability: people are dots, buildings and vehicles are squares, and hostile creatures use triangle markers.

Architectural features such as walls, floors, doors, paths, and conduits are designated per tile. Furniture, workstations, storage, and machines are placed as independent footprint-based objects. Both workflows need shared material accounting and worker tasks without conflating placement semantics.

## Currently implemented

- A 40 x 26 square tile map.
- Three colonists with independent position, movement task, cargo state, and hunger.
- Finite resource deposits.
- Real gather/carry/deliver trips that transfer resource from source deposit to inventory.
- Individual per-tile architecture construction orders with costs, work progress, and completion state.
- Footprint-based multi-tile object blueprints that remain unfinished until workers complete construction.
- Inventory-based construction and production costs.
- A functional production recipe: a completed workbench consumes alloy and wood and creates a component only after worker labor.
- Minimal orthogonal top-down rendering.
- Versioned local colony saves with structural validation and round-trip tests.
- A separate deterministic strategic campaign model with regional development, research, turns, battle reconciliation, and save/load tests.

## Known gaps

The strategic campaign model is not yet connected to the local colony screen flow or to colony population/resources. The colony still needs shared job ownership, job/material reservations, capacity-aware stockpiles, multiple recipe definitions and production chains, fuller needs/workplace simulation, save migration beyond the initial schema, and research that unlocks local mechanics. The world map is currently the separate nine-region campaign model, not a large connected civilization simulation. The Blight is still a simple local spread-and-cleanse model.

## Implementation priority

1. Extract central job assignment and resource reservations without changing verified gameplay behavior.
2. Generalize production definitions, workplace queues, stockpile capacity and delivery rules.
3. Add research projects that unlock actual buildings and recipes.
4. Connect strategic regions to real local settlement state and resource/person flows.
5. Expand colonist needs, housing, work eligibility, and the Blight ecosystem after shared state contracts are stable.
